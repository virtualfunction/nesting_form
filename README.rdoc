Nesting Form

This is similar to the nested_form plugin that Ryan Bates made as part of his Railscasts
See: https://github.com/ryanb/nested_form

This tries to work round some of the limitations with nested_form which appears 
to be unmaintained as of 2012. These include:

* Events to fire correctly (fired from fields rather than form object)
* Obey the correct wrapper for simple_form
* Allow use of table rows
* Not have <div class="fields"> as a hard coded wrapper
